# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, do not open a public issue first.

Please report it privately to the maintainers and include:

- Affected version/commit
- Reproduction steps
- Impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

Maintainers will acknowledge the report and provide a triage/update timeline.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest mainline release.
